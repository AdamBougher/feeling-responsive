Girls Who Code is an international non-profit organization working to close the gender gap in the technology industry and change the image of what a programmer looks like and does.  Northern Illinois University is proud to have an affiliate chapter of their College Loops initiative, in which we are helping to lead the movement to inspire, educate, and equip young women with the computing skills to pursue 21st-century opportunities.
